Challenge Title [#CommunityApps & #Auth] 
Alumni Connect -A Shared Digital Space for Every Campus 
Challenge Description 
Many colleges lack a dedicated space where alumni and students can interact 
meaningfully. Alumni Connect solves that. 
Your challenge is to build a lightweight, user-friendly platform where students and alumni 
from the same college can connect, share updates, advice, and job opportunities — allin 
one shared space per college. 
This project focuses on college-level community walls without complex approvals, 
making it ideal for newer developers — yet scalable enough for real-world usage.
